Goal of the project:
Analysing ransomware distribution
	Finding the optimal ransom
	Finding the optimal distribution pattern (Methods, Starting points, Victims)
	Correlation between local factors
Methods for distribution:
1. hired botnet (Spam, spearphishing)
2. affiliate
3. unaware carriers
4. spread from infected computers

for 2.:
	1/x model
for 1.:
	return/botnet traffic
for 4.:
	search for info in corporate cases
for 3.:
	get some data if possible

THE BASIC ONE:
Coeff's needed:
1. Likelihood of people paying the ransom
2. Ransom estimated value
3. Estimated file value

Things to work on:
1. Botnet traffic/Ransomware activity
2. Profit/Ransom correlations
3. Damage calculation
